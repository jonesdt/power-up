#
# Only host definitions are required. SSH keys can be automatically
# configured by pup or manually defined in this file.
#
# POWER-Up uses ssh keys to access the client nodes. If there is an
# existing ssh key pair available, you may enter it under the [all:vars]
# section (eg; ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/root/.ssh/your-private-key).
# If one is not available, POWER-Up will generate one for you. POWER-Up
# also needs an active user id for the client nodes. The POWER-Up
# software will prompt for the user id, or you may enter it under the
# [all:vars] section below (eg; ansible_ssh_user=egoadmin).
#
# Global variables can be defined via the [all:vars] group
#   e.g.:
#   [all:vars]
#   ansible_ssh_user=egoadmin
#
# Group names are defined within brackets
# Hosts are defined with an FQDN or IP address
#   e.g.:
#   [master]
#   host1.domain.com  # master host
#
#   [compute]
#   host3.domain.com  # compute host 1
#   host4.domain.com  # compute host 2

[master]
  # define master host on this line before the "#"
server-3

[compute]
  # define first compute host on this line before the "#"
